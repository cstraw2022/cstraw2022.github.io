            <p>Hi! My name’s Chris. I’m an incoming Graduate student at USC Viterbi, and a recent graduate from UCSB. When I'm not glued to the computer screen, in my free time I enjoy playing Nintendo games, tennis, violin, and going to support Nikkei Student Union meetings. Feel free to take a look at my research and experience below!</p>
